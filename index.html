                <h1>What is Valorant?</h1>
                <p>Valorant is a free-to-play first-person tactical hero shooter video game developed and published by Riot Games. The game was released on June 2, 2020, for Windows and later ported to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in June 2024, though without crossplay between PC and console clients. Valorant is set in a near-future version of Earth and features team-based gameplay where players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team, each consisting of five players.</p>

                <h2>Valorant Agents</h2>
                <p>Players choose from a set of Agents, characters based on various countries and cultures around the world, each with unique abilities. The main game mode, known as Search and Destroy, is similar to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's game modes, where attackers attempt to plant a bomb-like device called the Spike at designated bomb sites, while defenders aim to prevent the Spike from being planted or defuse it if planted.</p>
